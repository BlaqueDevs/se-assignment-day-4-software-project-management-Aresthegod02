## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile and Waterfall are two popular ways to manage software projects, but they work very differently.  

 **Waterfall Methodology**
**How it works:**  
- The project follows a strict, step-by-step plan (like a waterfall flowing down).  
- Each phase (planning → design → development → testing → deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.  
- Changes are difficult to make once the project has started.  

**Advantages:**  
. Clear structure and documentation.  
. Easy to manage for small projects with well-defined requirements.  
. Works well when the final product is clear from the start.  

**Disadvantages:**  
. Not flexible—if requirements change, it's hard to adapt.  
. Testing happens late, so mistakes may be found too late.  
. Long development time before users see anything.  

 **Agile Methodology** 
**How it works:**  
- The project is divided into short cycles (called **sprints**).  
- Teams build small parts of the software, get feedback, and improve continuously.  
- Changes can be made anytime based on new ideas or user needs.  

**Advantages:**  
. Super flexible—can adapt to changes easily.  
. Continuous feedback means fewer big mistakes.  
. Faster delivery—users see working versions early.  

**Disadvantages:**  
. Can be chaotic without proper management.  
. Requires close teamwork and frequent communication.  
. Harder to estimate costs and time because of changing requirements.  

**Which One to Use?** 
- **Use Waterfall** when the project is well-defined, like **building a banking system** where security and documentation are key.  
- **Use Agile** when requirements might change, like **developing a mobile app**, where user feedback is crucial.  
Both methods have their pros and cons, so it depends on the project.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

**Agile** is more beneficial in projects where flexibility, ongoing feedback, and frequent changes are expected. It’s ideal when the project scope is likely to evolve over time. 

**Examples where Agile is better:**
- **Software Development:** When building an app or website that requires continuous user feedback, Agile allows teams to adapt quickly to changes and deliver features incrementally.
